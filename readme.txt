Define custom post types, custom taxonomy and custom fields.

== Description ==

Types is your one-stop solution for creating custom content with WordPress. You can define:

* Custom post types
* Custom taxonomy
* Custom fields with fancy meta boxes

Learn more about Types in [WP Types home page](http://wp-types.com).

= Custom Posts and Taxonomy =

Use the GUI to define new post types and taxonomy. You can control menu positioning, labels and all the advanced features that WordPress offers.

Choose how your custom taxonomy relates to post types and holds together related content.

= Custom Fields =

Types lets you define meta boxes with custom fields. You can assign these boxes to posts, pages or any custom type. Your meta boxes can include standard and advanced fields:

* **Checkbox** - yes / no fields. You can control the text output for on and off.
* **Date** - shows a date-picker in the editor screen and lets you choose output formats when displaying
* **Email** - inputs and validates correct email format
* **File** - allows uploading files to posts and displays a download link on public pages
* **Image** - allows uploading images and displaying them at different sizes with a resize cache
* **Numeric** - lets writers enter number data only by validating its content
* **Phone** - validates format for phone numbers and allows to display them with special styling
* **Radio** - displays multiple text options as radio buttons
* **Select** - displays multiple text options as a drop-down select input
* **Skype** - displays the Skype graphics, showing when you're available
* **Single-line text** - a single text line
* **Multi-line text** - a paragraph of text
* **URL** - validates URL format and displays a link on public pages

= Fully WPML Compatible =

The same folks who wrote [WPML](http://wpml.org) have created this plugin. Types and WPML play perfectly together. You can translate all labels via WPML's String Translation, without any configuration.

When you translate content that includes custom fields, these fields will appear in WPML's Translation Editor. Also, content synchronization between different languages is fully supported.

= Display Custom Content with Flair =

Types creates shortcodes for inserting custom fields into the WordPress editor. Your new fields will be available to editors. Just click on the T menu and choose which field to insert.

You can use [Types' API](http://wp-types.com/documentation/functions/) functions to insert fields to PHP template files.

If you want to save time re-inventing the wheel, but still want full control of how your site displays, we recommend that you check out [Views](http://wp-types.com), the perfect companion for Types. Together, Types and Views allow building complex WordPress sites, without any coding.


== Installation ==

1. Upload 'types' to the '/wp-content/plugins/' directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
